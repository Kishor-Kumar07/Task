Logic for the seating arrangement problem

The blocks of the airplane is taken as individual arrays
In the input [[3,4],[2,3]]
The second elements 4 & 3 are considered as the row and 3 & 2 as the columns
A loop - while i<31 where i=1
For the first array consider the -1 index and if the index is empty fill it with the value i+1
In the subsequent arrays fill the 0 & -1 indices with i+1 
And for the last array the index 0 alone is filled with i+1
Once all the aisle seats are filled,set a variable to true 
if this one becomes true,then the first array's 0th index is filled with i+1
then the last one's index is filled with i+1
If all the arrays with these indices are filled then set a variable to true
Once this happens then the center ones are filled by having a loop
